### Introduction

C# is a object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used to build Windows applications, web applications, mobile apps, games (using Unity), and enterprise software systems.

C# runs on the .NET runtime, which allows applications to execute on multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux with .NET Core and later versions of .NET. Its syntax is similar to other C-based languages like C++ and Java.
